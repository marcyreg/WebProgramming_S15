1. **Purpose** 
	* This github repository is a culmination of all of my deliverables during the Spring Semester of 2015 in Webprogramming at Tufts University.
2. **Favoriate Assignment**
	* The assignment where I learned, enjoyed, and excelled the most with my newly found JavaScript skills and implemtation of design and effects onto the page was Assignment 2: mmap (The Real Marauder's Map). This assignment applied my understanding of first-class function with the most real time applicability. This project is what confirmed my love for Front-End Development and wish I had had more time to improve the UI of the website. 
3. **Growth**
	* This course enabled me to know that Front-End Development is something that I am passionate about and good at. It made me wish I could have taken more computer science courses at Tufts; however, this class alone gave me a strong foundation for future growth. 
4. **Most Important Lessons** *(Citing two examples as evidence)*
	* The first lesson that I learned was distinguishing what other sources of information I had access to via Stackoverflow.com, Piazza, and just having the ability to teach and learn together with other students in the course.
	* The second lesson I learned in this class is ensuring that I am comfortable and confident in learning on my own. The internet of things are constantly changing: getting better, faster, stronger, and having the ability to learn on your own is so important to ensure you constantly adapt with ever changing technology.
5. **Future steps**
	* Now that I've taken this course, I want to take another course that dives further into JavaScript for Front-End Development. Then look into mobile development for iOS and Android applications because as both a Engineering Psychology (Human Factors) major and avid entrepreneur, I would love to have the full skill set to create optimized design and development for User Interfaces and overall User Experience.
