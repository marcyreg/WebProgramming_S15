1. There was an extension asked for Assignment 2. I will email Ming once the assignment is completed. 
*There has been a lot of work to see what functions are being executed when, understanding JavaScript and JSON files more deeply. First I started with ensuring that the Google Maps API works to display the map.

*Setting up the map to show with my location was easy once I looked into first class functions and understanding the structure and the order of the process. Though one problem I was facing that I had no idea was an issue until I took a step back and looked at my browswer... I had my location blocked under my browswer settings. Reminder to self: always step back to look at the big picture.

*Had an issue with setting up gh-pages due to the previous messages lab. For some reason there was an issue with "merging" due to my .DS_Store file. I tried many ways in trying to override it, though was not successful. Created gh-pages2 as a second branch to push everything to. Went back and tried to delete the branches to create gh-pages within mmap. Had to restore all of my files from Time Machine (thank the Lord it exists). Had to delete the branches locally and then on github.com. After the third attempt, finally gh-pages was created and origin was pushed to it.

*Finallly finished after days of challenge, but now I have a better understanding for JavaScript, JSON, and JSON parsing. Feeling good :) Note: Interestingly the distance calcuated is for a direct shot aka direct travel only possible via air travel. I wonder how Google gets it's distances. They must use another function to calculate distance.

2. During my dark time, a small light in the distance was seen... that light was Thomas Colgrove. It was great to bounce ideas off of him and also ensure I holistically thinking about JSON and Javascript correctly. Many thanks to him!
