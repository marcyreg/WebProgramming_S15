1. Figuring out the drawImage () function was difficult; however I understand the slicing capabilities. Really great tool and learning the various components of of drawing an image took some time, but finally have it figured out! Definitely will be using this in the update of my personal website later on this semester.

2. This time around I did not have the chance to talk with anyone or collaborate with.

3. About 2 hours.
